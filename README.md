# richthedev-live
This is the code for my portfolio website. It is in Golang, and hosted via Docker on an EC2 instance. I published this for anyone who is trying to create a website of their own in Golang.

## Setup
To work locally, or in production, you need to update your database creds in the .env and local.env files respectively.

Compile daemon is a dependency for easy continuous save/rebuilds when testing locally.
